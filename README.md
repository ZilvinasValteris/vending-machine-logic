My understanding of Part 1:

Amount of money put in will be divided into the optimal number of valid coins.
int denominator or class Coin will be set to that amount and returned by public Collection<Coin> getOptimalChangeFor(int pence)


THE PUZZLE: do I need to only have the number of coins to be returned set in the Coin class or do I need the values of those coins as well?
